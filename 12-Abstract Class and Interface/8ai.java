                                       //interface donot have constructor so object class is not parent of interface....but its like class its .class file is made

                                       //interface is also used when we want functionality from 2 classes(multiple inheritance)
    void fun();   //we know child class will give body to it so compiler give abstract and public keyword to these methods internally see bytecode 
    void gun();   //bydefault public abstract
